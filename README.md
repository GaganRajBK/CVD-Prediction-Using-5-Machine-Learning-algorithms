# CVD Prediction Using 5 Machine Learning algorithms

## Overview
Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is a leading cause of mortality worldwide, making early detection critical.  
This project aims to predict the likelihood of heart disease using five machine learning algorithms.  
By analyzing medical data, the system provides an estimate of heart disease risk, aiding both individuals  
and healthcare professionals in early diagnosis.

## Features

### **Machine Learning Models Used:**
- **Logistic Regression**
- **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**
- **Support Vector Machine (SVM)**
- **Decision Tree**
- **Random Forest**

### **Additional Features:**
- üñ• **User-Friendly Interface**: Built with Flask, allowing users to input medical data and receive predictions.  
- üìä **Data-Driven Insights**: Uses a dataset from Kaggle to train and validate the models.  
- ‚úÖ **Accuracy Analysis**: Compares model performance to determine the most effective approach.
